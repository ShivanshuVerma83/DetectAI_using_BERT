Introduction
AI-generated content is becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it challenging to distinguish between genuine and computer-generated text. Our project aims to tackle this issue by leveraging the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to identify and flag AI-generated text segments. Whether you're dealing with chatbots, articles, or social media posts, our solution offers accurate detection, ensuring the authenticity of digital content.

Features
BERT-Powered Detection: We utilize state-of-the-art BERT models to analyze the semantic context and linguistic nuances, enabling precise identification of AI-generated text.
Effortless Integration: Seamlessly integrate our solution into your existing applications or workflows, ensuring hassle-free implementation for developers and researchers.
High Accuracy: Our model is meticulously trained and fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy, minimizing false positives and false negatives for reliable results.
User-Friendly Interface: With intuitive interfaces and clear instructions, users can easily navigate and utilize the detection tool without any technical expertise.
Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to get started with our AI-Generated Text Detection tool:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-generated-text-detection.git
cd ai-generated-text-detection
Access the generated submission.csv file to explore the detected AI-generated text segments and their respective confidence scores.
How It Works
Our solution follows a comprehensive approach to AI-generated text detection:

Data Preprocessing: We clean and preprocess the textual data, removing noise and irrelevant information to enhance the accuracy of our model.

BERT Tokenization: Leveraging the BERT tokenizer, we encode the preprocessed text, preparing it for input into our detection model.

Model Training: Using a BERT-based sequence classification model, we train the system to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated text with a high degree of accuracy.

Predictions: Once trained, the model generates predictions for test data, highlighting potential AI-generated content segments.

Result Analysis: The results are saved in a CSV file, allowing users to review and analyze the detected segments along with their confidence scores.
